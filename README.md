# MiniKet 🐾  
**A ceremonial archive for pets and veterinarians. Built with SwiftUI.**

MiniKet is a non-commercial iOS application designed to honor memory, track events, and support emotional rituals for pet owners and veterinary professionals.  
It includes features such as:

- 🎂 Birthday and event tracking  
- 🩺 Vet-only modes  
- 📍 Manual location selection  
- 🌐 Region and language customization  
- 🕊️ Emotional persistence without Core Data

This project is deeply personal. It’s not about monetization — it’s about memory.

## ⚠️ Current Status

The project is complete in concept, but currently contains **a large number of errors** (over 2000).  
Many are related to structure, type mismatches, and SwiftUI view composition.

I’m seeking help from someone with:

- A Mac (with Xcode installed)  
- Experience in SwiftUI (or willingness to explore)  
- An Apple Developer account (optional, but helpful for signing the `.ipa`)  
- Empathy for emotional software and ceremonial design

## 🙏 What I’m asking

I’m not asking for publishing, ownership, or long-term commitment.  
I simply need help compiling the project and generating a **signed `.ipa` file**, so I can install it on my personal device using AltStore.

If you’re able to:

1. Open the project in Xcode  
2. Help clean up the most critical errors  
3. Compile and sign the `.ipa`  
4. Return the `.ipa` to me privately

…you’ll be helping bring a memory-focused app to life.

## 💬 Contact

Feel free to open an issue, fork the project, or reach out directly.  
I’m happy to explain the emotional context, technical goals, and ceremonial vision behind MiniKet.

Thank you for reading — and for considering this request.
